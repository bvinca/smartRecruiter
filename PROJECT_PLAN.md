# SmartRecruiter: Project Plan & Dissertation Roadmap

## 🎯 Project Overview
SmartRecruiter is an intelligent Applicant Tracking System (ATS) that integrates AI, NLP, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to automate resume analysis, candidate scoring, and recruiter communication. The goal is to build a transparent and fair recruitment process that enhances accuracy and efficiency through embedded intelligence.
